# Dashboard

For this portion of the assignment, please note the following:

* First we will open Anadonca Prompt with PyViz environment
* Once you are in file directory that has "dashboard.ipynb" proceed with the command "panel serve dashboard.ipynb"
* A local host link should appear. Open this link in any browser. (My bokeh app running at: http://localhost:5006/dashboard)
* This link should pull up the interactive dashboard for dashboard.ipynb
